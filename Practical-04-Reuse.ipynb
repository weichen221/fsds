    "Let’s now think about how to approach problems in programming (with\n",
    "code) and how that might differ from other ways of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we will use here as an example is: *download a data file\n",
    "that we know is hosted on a web site and output some information about\n",
    "those data*. This sounds hard. It *is* hard when you’re just starting\n",
    "out in programming. But it is *not* hard for a computer… *iff* we can\n",
    "figure out what to tell it to do *and* make use of work that other\n",
    "people have done for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What Do We Do? Break It Down!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Step 1. Analyse the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to writing a program is thinking about your goal and the\n",
    "steps required to achieve that. We ***don’t*** write programs like we\n",
    "write essays: all at once by writing a whole lot of code and then hoping\n",
    "for the best when we hit ‘submit’. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re tackling a programming problem you break it down into\n",
    "separate, simpler steps, and then tick them off one by one. Doing this\n",
    "gets easier as you become more familiar with programming, but it remains\n",
    "crucial and, in many cases, good programmers in large companies spend\n",
    "more time on *design* than they do on actual *coding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Step 2. Functions & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed how *functions* are a useful programming tool to\n",
    "enable us to re-use chunks of code. Basically, a function is a way to do\n",
    "something to something in a portable, easy-to-use little bundle of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some steps in a program are done so many times by so many people that,\n",
    "eventually, someone writes a *package* that bundles up those operations\n",
    "into something easy to use that saves *you* having to figure out the\n",
    "gory details. Reading a file (even one on a computer halfway round the\n",
    "world) is one of those things. Making sense of the data *in* that file\n",
    "for you is probably not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"\n",
    "alt=\"xkcd: Easy vs. Hard\" />\n",
    "<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">xkcd: Easy vs. Hard</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "To a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site\n",
    "halfway around the world) is not really any different from reading one\n",
    "that’s sitting on your your local hard drive (e.g. on your desktop). To\n",
    "simplify things a great deal: the computer really just needs to know the\n",
    "location of the file and an appropriate *protocol* for accessing that\n",
    "file (*e.g.* http, https, ftp, local…) and then a clever programming\n",
    "language like Python will typically have packages that can kind of take\n",
    "of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases – local and remote – you use the package to handle the hard\n",
    "bit of knowing how to actually ‘read’ data (because all files are just\n",
    "`1`s and `0`s of data) at the *device* level and then Python gives you\n",
    "back a ‘file handle’ that helps you to achieve things like ‘read a line’\n",
    "or ‘close an open file’. You can think of a filehandle as something that\n",
    "gives you a ‘grip’ on a file-like object no matter where or what it is,\n",
    "and the package is the way that this magic is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Step 3. Look for Ways to Recycle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always** look for ways to avoid reinventing the wheel. This is where\n",
    "Python’s packages (or R’s for that matter) come into their own. If it’s\n",
    "something that programmers often need to do, then chances are that\n",
    "someone has written a package to do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of packages is that they can help us to achieve quite a lot\n",
    "very quickly since we can just make use of someone else’s code. In the\n",
    "same way that we won’t mark you down for Googling the answer to a coding\n",
    "question, we *also* won’t mark you down for using someone else’s package\n",
    "to help you get going with your programming. ***That’s the whole\n",
    "point!***\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, if you’re not sure where to start, Google (or StackOverflow) is\n",
    "the place to go:\n",
    "\n",
    "[`how to read text file on web server python`](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+to+read+text+file+on+web+server+python&oq=how+to+read+text+file+on+web+server+python&aqs=chrome..69i57.629j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boom!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.4 Step 4. Make a Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so we need to break this *hard* problem down into something simpler.\n",
    "We can do this by thinking about it as three separate steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We want to read a remote file (i.e. a text file somewhere the\n",
    "    planet),\n",
    "2.  We want to turn it into a local data structure (i.e a list or a\n",
    "    dictionary),\n",
    "3.  We want to perform some calculations on the data (e.g. calculate the\n",
    "    mean, find the easternmost city, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can tackle each of those in turn, getting the first bit working, then\n",
    "adding the second bit, etc. It’s just like using lego to build\n",
    "something: you take the same pieces and assemble them in different ways\n",
    "to produce different things.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "### 4.1 Understanding What’s an ‘Appropriate’ Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you stop to think about it, then our list-of-lists approach to the\n",
    "data isn’t very easy to navigate. Notice that if the position or name of\n",
    "a column changes then we need to change our program *every* time we\n",

    "errors!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider that, in order to calculate out even a simple aggregate\n",
    "such as the `sum` of a field for all rows we need to step through a lot\n",
    "of irrelevant data as well: we have to write a `for` loop and then step\n",
    "through each row with an ‘accumulator’ (somewhere to store the total).\n",
    "That’s slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn’t make much sense since this should all be *easier* and\n",
    "*faster* in Python than in Excel, but right now it’s *harder*, and quite\n",
    "possibly *slower* as well! So how does the experienced programmer get\n",
    "around this? ‘Simple’ (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know\n",
    "the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We\n",
    "humans tend to think in rows of data: this apartment has the following\n",
    "*attributes* (price, location, etc.), or that city has the following\n",
    "*attributes* (population, location). We read across the row because\n",
    "that’s the easiest way for *us* to think about it. But, in short, a\n",
    "list-of-lists does *not* seem to be the right way to store this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a computer doesn’t have to work that way. For a computer,\n",
    "it’s as easy to read *down* a column as it is to read *across* a row.\n",
    "**In fact, it’s easier**, because each column has the same *type* of\n",
    "data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains\n",
    "prices (integers or floats), and other columns contain other types of\n",
    "data (floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often\n",
    "doesn’t matter as long as we know what the columns are called: it’s\n",
    "easier to ask for the ‘description column’ than it is to ask for the 6th\n",
    "column since, for all we know, the description column might be in a\n",
    "different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely\n",
    "to use the ‘description’ label for the column itself.\n",

    "### 4.2 A Dictionary of Lists to the Rescue\n",
